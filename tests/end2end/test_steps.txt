| Step | Description | Verification |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Open Outlook. Launch the Outlook desktop app. Wait for the main window to fully load. | Outlook window is visible. The left sidebar shows inbox emails, the top toolbar with "Home", "View", "Help" tabs is present. Look for the Outlook logo or "Outlook" text in the title bar. |
| 2 | Click the "New mail" button. It is typically located in the top-left area of the toolbar, often with a "✉+" icon or labeled "New mail". In the accessibility tree, look for a button role with name containing "New mail" or "New message". | Compose page is displayed. A new email editor panel appears with "To", "Cc", "Subject" fields at the top. In the accessibility tree, look for input fields with name "To" or a contenteditable region for the message body. The toolbar switches to show compose-related tabs like "Insert", "Format text", "Options". |
| 3 | Click on the email body editor area (the large blank content area below the Subject field). It is a contenteditable div or an iframe with role "textbox" or "document" in the accessibility tree. To verify cursor activation, type a space character and then press Backspace to delete it. | Cursor is blinking inside the editor. The typed space appears and is successfully deleted by Backspace, confirming the editor is focused and accepts input. In the accessibility tree, the editor element should have focused state. |
| 4 | Click the "Table" button in the toolbar. First click the "Insert" tab in the top menu bar if not already active. Then find the "Table" button in the Insert ribbon — look for a button with role "menuitem" or "button" whose name contains "Table", often with a grid icon. Click it to open the table size picker dropdown. | Table dropdown menu is opened. A grid of cells (e.g., 10×8 grid) appears as a popup/dropdown, allowing the user to hover and select the desired table dimensions. In the accessibility tree, look for a popup, menu, or dialog element that was not present before. The dropdown may also show text like "Insert Table" or display row×column count as you hover. |
| 5 | Hover over the cells in the table dropdown grid to select the desired table size (e.g., move to the 3rd column, 3rd row cell for a 3×3 table). The grid cells highlight as you hover. Click the target cell to insert the table. | Table is inserted into the email body. The dropdown is dismissed. In the editor area, a table element with the selected number of rows and columns is visible. In the accessibility tree, look for a "table" role element inside the editor, containing "row" and "cell" child elements. The table should have visible borders/gridlines in the screenshot. |
| 6 | Click the table selector handle to select the entire table. This is a small icon (often "⊞" or "☐" shape) that appears at the top-left corner of the table when you hover over or click inside the table. In the accessibility tree, look for a button with name containing "select" or "table" near the table element. Alternatively, click inside a cell and use Ctrl+A twice to select the entire table. | The whole table is selected, indicated by a blue highlight or selection border covering all cells. In the accessibility tree, the table or its cells may show a "selected" state. In the screenshot, all cells should have a highlighted/shaded appearance. |
| 7 | Drag the table resize handle to resize the entire table. The resize handle is a small square dot (■) at the bottom-right corner of the table. Move the mouse to this handle (cursor should change to a diagonal resize arrow ↘), then click-and-drag it outward or inward to increase or decrease the table size. Use mouse down at the handle position, move to the target position, then mouse up. | The table dimensions have changed compared to before the drag. Measure the table's bounding box in the screenshot — width and/or height should differ from the original size. The table cells should also reflect the resized proportions. |
| 8 | Insert a new row or column into the table. Right-click inside a table cell, then the context menu(contains "Font", "Bold", "Text highlight color" and so on) is shown. In the context menu, look for an item with name containing "More options" and click it. Then in the submenu, click "Insert", then all the insert options will be listed.". | A new row or column has been added to the table. Compare the table's row count or column count before and after — it should increase by 1. In the accessibility tree, verify the table now contains an additional "row" or "cell" element. In the screenshot, the table should visually show one more row or column than before. |
| 9 | Drag a column or row boundary line to adjust column width or row height. Move the mouse to the border line between two columns (vertical line) or two rows (horizontal line) inside the table. The cursor should change to a column-resize (↔) or row-resize (↕) shape. Then click-and-drag the line left/right or up/down to the desired position. Use mouse down on the border line, move to the target offset, then mouse up. | The column width or row height has changed. In the screenshot, the targeted column/row should be visibly wider/narrower or taller/shorter than before the drag. Other columns/rows may also adjust proportionally. Compare the position of the border line before and after to confirm the change. |
